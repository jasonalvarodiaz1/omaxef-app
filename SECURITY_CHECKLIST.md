- [ ] XSS protection verified
- [ ] Parameter validation middleware added

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL (basic validation exists, needs comprehensive middleware)

---

### 8. Error Handling

- [ ] Penetration testing passed
- [ ] OWASP ZAP scan completed (no HIGH findings)
- [ ] PHI redaction tested thoroughly
- [ ] All security controls validated
- [ ] Load testing completed

**Status:** ‚ùå NOT COMPLETE

---

### 12. Compliance & Documentation

- [ ] Data flow diagrams documented
- [ ] Security architecture documented
- [ ] Incident response playbook created
- [ ] Vendor Security Questionnaire (VSQ) completed
- [ ] BAA signed with all external vendors

**Status:** ‚ùå NOT COMPLETE

## üîß Configuration Files Status

| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `server/tokenExchange.js` | ‚úÖ Updated | Need to deploy with env vars |
| `src/security/phiHandler.js` | ‚úÖ Updated | Need backend audit endpoint |
| `src/config/security.js` | ‚úÖ Updated | Ready for production |
| `src/utils/monitoring.js` | ‚úÖ Updated | Need backend log endpoint |
| `.env.production` | ‚ùå Missing | Create from template |

## üöÄ Deployment Readiness Score

**Current Score:** 25/100 ‚ùå

### Blocking Issues:
1. ‚ùå Secrets in environment variables (not Key Vault)
2. ‚ùå No persistent audit logging backend
3. ‚ùå No BAA signed with external services
4. ‚ùå Token exchange server not production-hardened
5. ‚ùå No HTTPS certificate configured

### To Reach 100:
- Complete all CRITICAL BLOCKERS (50 points)
- Complete all HIGH PRIORITY items (30 points)
- Complete all MEDIUM PRIORITY items (20 points)
